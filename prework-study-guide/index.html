          <li>The head element contains information, or metadata, that helps render the page correctly. Elements included in this element are not visible to the user.</li>
          <li>The meta element contains information about the page that is used by the browser.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user. All elements we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside this element.</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for the webpage, which can be seen in the browser tab. It is required and very important for SEO.</li>

          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>A period can be used to designate a class selector, so that any HTML element assigned to that class will gain the property assignments from the CSS.</li>
          <li>Use a link element to create a connection to the HTML file. The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current doc and the linked resource. The href attribute specifies the location of the external resource.</li>

          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>Steps to stage/commit/push feature to Github and verify current branch is up to date:</li>
          <li>git add -A: the add command adds modifications in the current working branch to the staging area. The -A flag indicates that we want to add all changes</li>
          <li>git commit -m "commit message": creates a commit that captures a snapshot of the staged changes with a comment describing changes.</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: ensures current branch is up to date befor opening a pull request.</li>
          <li>git push origin feature/new-branch</li>
          <li>navigate to Github repo and ensure proper comparison between main and new branch - then merge.</li>

          <li>Author identity unknown error - run the below two commands:</li>

          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>Control flow dictates that JS files are executed from top to bottom, so order matters!</li>
          <li>A function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
          <li>There are two requirements for a function: declare the function, then call the function.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data.</li>
          <li>Strings in side of an array need quotations; numbers and Booleans do not need quotations.</li>
          <li>In JS, arrays are zer-indexed and sequential, i.e., the first item has an index of 0, not 1.</li>
          <li>A for loop contains three statements: 1- the starting point for the loop, i.e., x = 0, 2- the condition statement, i.e., x < var.length, 3- a statement that allows the loop to iterate over each item in the array, i.e., x++.</li>
